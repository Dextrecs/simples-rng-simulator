🎲 Simple's RNG Simulator

A minimal, open-source web game focused on the thrill of chance.
Simple's RNG Simulator is a simple incremental game built entirely on the concept of rolling for increasingly rare and valuable items. There's no complex combat, just pure probability and the satisfaction of watching your item count and money grow!

✨ Key Features

Pure RNG: Test your luck against a list of over 20 rarities, including "Dirt," "Galaxy," and the ultra-rare "Omnipotent" (1 in 250,000 chance).

Incremental Progress: Purchase luck upgrades to tilt the odds in your favor.
Automation: Buy and upgrade the Auto-Roll feature to grind for high-tier items hands-free.

Inventory & Selling: Manage your collection, sell common items in bulk, or choose specific rarities for profit.
Customization: Includes theme options and particle effects for a personalized experience.
